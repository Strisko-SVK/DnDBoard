Here is a complete design proposal for the D&D Quest Board web application, including visuals for key interfaces.

1. The Main Board (Desktop View)
   This is the heart of the application, designed to feel like a cluttered notice board in a fantasy tavern. It uses a masonry grid layout where quests are pinned as individual parchment notes.

Immersive Theme: Dark wood background, leather sidebar, and textured parchment cards create a strong fantasy atmosphere.

Functional Toolbar: The top wooden bar contains a search field, wax-seal style filters for difficulty and status, and a brass padlock icon for the DM to lock the board.

Card Details: Each card shows a clear title, a difficulty indicator (skull icon), a short summary, and small icons at the bottom for rewards.

2. The Quest Preview Modal (Desktop View)
   When a player clicks on a quest card, it opens this detailed modal, presented as a large unfurled scroll.

Rich Content: The left side features the full quest description, objectives, and flavor text, formatted with rich text.

Logistics & Rewards: The right side showcases the rewards (XP, Gold, Items) on a wooden plaque and a gallery of any attached images or maps.

Clear Actions: Large, thematic buttons for Accept Quest and Decline are prominent. If the board is locked by the DM, these would appear disabled (greyed out).

3.    Mobile Quest Preview with Sticky Footer
   The design is fully responsive. On a mobile device, the quest preview is presented in a single, scrollable column for easy reading.

Mobile-Friendly Layout: The two-column desktop layout is neatly stacked into one.

Sticky Action Bar: Crucially, the Accept and Decline buttons are placed in a fixed "sticky footer" at the bottom of the screen. This ensures they are always visible and accessible, no matter how long the quest description is, preventing the need for excessive scrolling.
